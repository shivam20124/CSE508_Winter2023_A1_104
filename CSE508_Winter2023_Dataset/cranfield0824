on the concept of stability of inelastic systems . simple models are employed to bring out the large and importantdifferences between buckling in the plastic range andclassical elastic instability .  static and kinetic criteria are comparedand their interrelation discussed .  nonlinear behavior inparticular is often found to be the key to the physically validsolution .  the nonconservative nature of plastic deformation initself or in combination with the nonlinearity requires conceptsnot found in classical approaches .  conversely, the classicallinearized condition of neutral equilibrium is really not relevantin inelastic buckling .  plastic buckling loads are not uniquelydefined but cover a range of values and are often more properlythought of as maximum loads for some reasonable initial imperfectionin geometry or dynamic disturbance .the models indicate that basically the same information isobtained from essentially static systems by assuming initial imperfectionin geometric forms as by assuming dynamic disturbances.  one approach complements the other and both are helpfulin obtaining an understanding of the physical phenomena .
