investigation of free turbulent mixing . a discussion of the integralrelations for flow of the boundarylayertype is presented .  it isshown that the characteristic laws ofspread of jets, wakes, and so forth,can be obtained directly for thelaminar case and, with the help ofdimensional reasoning, for the turbulentcase as well .measurements of the mean velocity,the intensity and scale of theturbulent fluctuations, and of the turbulentshear in a two-dimensionalmixing zone are presented .  the results ofthese measurements are comparedwith the mixing-length theories .  itis shown that both mixinglength and exchange coefficient vary acrossthe mixing zone .  the theoriesbased on the assumption of constantmixing length or exchangecoefficient are thus in error .a discussion of the energy balance ofthe fluctuating motion isgiven and the triple correlation is estimated .
