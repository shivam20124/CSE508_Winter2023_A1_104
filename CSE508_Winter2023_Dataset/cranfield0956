elastic stability of simply supported corrugated coresand- wich cylinders . theoretical buckling coefficientsare obtained for the general instabilityof simply supported, corrugatedcore sandwich circular cylindersunder combined loads with the coreoriented parallel to the longitudinalaxis of the cylinder .  bucklingcurves are presented for axialcompression, external lateral pressure,torsion, and some typical interactions.  the differential equations ofequilibrium used to obtain thebuckling equations were derived from thesmall deflection equations ofstein and mayer which include the effectof deformation due to transverseshear .  these equations are solvedby galerkin's equation .  remarksare made concerning the probablevalidity of the results of thesmall deflection theory for sandwich shells .
