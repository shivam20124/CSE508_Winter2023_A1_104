theory of stagnation point heat transfer in dissociatedair . the boundary-layer equations are developed in general for thecase of very high speed flight where the external flow is in a dissociatedstate .  in particular the effects of diffusion and of atomrecombination in the boundary layer are included .  it is shownthat at the stagnation point the equations can be reduced exactlyto a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations even when thechemical reactions proceed so slowly that the boundary layer isnot in thermochemical equilibrium .two methods of numerical solution of these stagnation pointequations are presented, one for the equilibrium case and theother for the nonequilibrium case .  numerical results are correlatedin terms of the parameters entering the numerical formulationso as not to depend critically on the physical assumptionsmade .for the nonequilibrium boundary layer, both catalytic (toatom recombination) and noncatalytic wall surfaces are considered.  a solution is represented which shows the transitionfrom the /frozen/ boundary layer (very slow recombinationrates) to the equilibrium boundary layer (fast recombination rates) .a recombination rate parameter is introduced to interpret thenonequilibrium results, and it is shown that a scale factor is involvedin relating the equilibrium state of a boundary layer onbodies of different sizes .it is concluded that the heat transfer through the equilibriumstagnation point boundary layer can be computed accurately bya simple correlation formula and that the heattransfer is almost unaffected by a nonequilibrium state of theboundary layer provided the wall is catalytic and the lewisnumber near unity .
