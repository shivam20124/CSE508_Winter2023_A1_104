magnetohydrodynamic flow past a semi-infinite plate . the flow of viscous electrically conducting fluidpast a semi-infinite plate is considered .  the appliedconstant magnetic field and the constant oncomingvelocity of the fluid are in the direction parallelto the plate .in addition to reynolds number the flow in theboundary layer depends on two parametersand .  the two simultaneousordinary nonlinear differential equations are solved bythe asymptotic method for the cases whenand respectively .the main results obtained are as follows .  the equationscan be solved exactly for and  .the perturbation effect from infinity when k is largedepends on, whereas the perturbation effect fromzero when k is small depends on .  for large k, includingthere is no solution for .  it isassumed that the fluid is incompressible with constantphysical properties .
