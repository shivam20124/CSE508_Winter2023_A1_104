dynamic stability of a missile in rolling flight . the paper sets down the equations of motion for a symmetricrolling missile with respect to axes attached to the missile .  themissile may be jet (or rocket) propelled or coasting under acceleratingor decelerating conditions, respectively, wherein the variablerolling velocity is derived from intentionally or unintentionally/canted/ fins and or wings .the equations contain a force and moment system that includes,in addition to the usual forces and moments, those due tomagnus effects, misaligned surfaces, canted surfaces, jet misalignment,and the linear accelerations in the plane normal to the missileaxis .the results present general stability criteria for a rolling missilewhich are summarized in the /discussion of stability ./
