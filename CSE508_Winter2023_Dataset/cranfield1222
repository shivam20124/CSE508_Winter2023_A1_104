axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic channel flow . the axisymmetric subsonic and supersonic flow fields, and theskin friction and heat transfer of an electrically conducting compressiblefluid flowing in a channel of constant circular areathrough a magnetic field are investigated when the magneticreynolds number is small .  the inviscid-flow field for flowthrough a dipole field is solved by the method of characteristicsin the supersonic case .  for the subsonic case, linearized equationsare derived for small values of the magnetic interactionparameter .  numerical results are obtained by the relaxationmethod .the inviscid-flow-field solutions are used as boundary conditionsfor the laminar boundary layer along the wall, in whichaxial pressure gradients form an important feature .  the exactcontinuum-flow equations are reduced by an order-of-magnitudeanalysis to the boundary-layer equations, which are solved numericallyby an integral method using a fourth-degree velocityprofile and a fifth-degree stagnation-enthalpy profile .pressure, temperature, and heat-transfer measurements aremade with a shock tube under supersonic-flow conditions closelyapproaching those used in the numerical computations .  generalagreement is found between the theoretical and the experimentalresults .
