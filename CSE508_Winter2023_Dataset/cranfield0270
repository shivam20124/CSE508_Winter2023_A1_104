on combined free and forced convection laminar magnetohydrodynamicflow and heat transfer in channels with transversemagnetic field . combined free and forced convective heat transferin vertical channels has been studied by many researchers.  due to the need for engineering designinformation there have been many papers concerningcases of fully developed flow with varying wall temperature.  forced flows in a channel of electricallyconducting fluid with a transverse magnetic fieldhave been studied and the large effects of a magneticfield on the flow pattern have been established .flows of combined free and forced convection inelectrically conducting fluids in vertical channelswith a transverse magnetic field are expected to attractattention in future engineering applications, forexample, in a magneto-hydrodynamic generator or inplasma studies .  however, except for a report bygershuni and zhukhovitskii (1) concerning a particularcase, no general study has been published .this paper is a general treatment of fully developed,free and forced convective, laminar, magnetohydrodynamicflow in a vertical channel with a transversemagnetic field .  it includes combined free andforced convective flows in channels without a magneticfield reported by ostrach (2), tao (3), etc. asspecial cases .  hartmann flow (4) is included in theother limit .
