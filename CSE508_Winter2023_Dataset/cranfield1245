some aspects of nonequilibrium flows . in this paper are discussed some of the general features of nonequilibriumflow .  in particular, vibrational relaxation is discussedin detail .  this case is somewhat simpler than dissociationand ionization but it illustrates some of the main new features ofnonequilibrium flow .  those aspects of two-dimensional andaxisymmetric flow behind shock waves are examined analyticallywhich yield significant information without requiring numericalsolution of the governing equations .the thermodynamics of a vibrational relaxing gas are discussed.  the conditions for simulating flows are noted .  crocco'stheorem and the characteristic equations are derived .  then asimple method of obtaining the initial gradients of the flow variablesbehind a shock is shown .  these gradients are used in discussingtwo particular flows .  an exact solution for flow over acusped body is obtained .  flow over a wedge near the tip andfar from the tip is considered .  it is found that far from the tipa boundary-layer type phenomenon occurs .
