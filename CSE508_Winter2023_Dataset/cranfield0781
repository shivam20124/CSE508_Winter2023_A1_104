use of subsonic kernel function in an influence-coefficient method ofaeroelastic analysis and some comparisons with experiment . this paper illustrates the development and application of aninfluence-coefficient method of analysis for calculating the responseof a flexible wing in an airstream to an oscillating disturbing forceand for treating such aeroelastic instabilities as flutter and divergence.  aerodynamic coefficients are derived on the basis of liftingsurfacetheory for subsonic compressible flow by use of the method presentedin nasa technical report r-48 .application of the analysis is made to a uniform cantilever wingtiptank configuration for which responses to a sinusoidal disturbingforce and flutter speeds were measured over a range of subsonic machnumbers and densities .  calculated responses and flutter speeds basedon flexibility influence coefficients measured at nine stations are ingood agreement with experiment, provided the aerodynamic load is distributedover the wing so that local centers of pressure very nearlycoincide with these nine influence stations .  the use of experimentalvalues of bending and torsional structural damping coefficients in theanalysis generally improved the agreement between calculated andexperimental responses .  some calculations were made to study theeffects of density on responses near the flutter conditions, and linearresponse trends were obtained over a wide range of densities .
