shock wave effects on the laminar skin friction ofan insulated flat plate at hypersonic speeds . an approximate theory on the phenomena of interaction betweenthe shock wave and the laminar boundary layer on an insulatedflat plate at hypersonic speeds has been formulated .  resultson the rate of growth of the boundary-layer thickness andthe rate of decay of the shock-wave strength have been foundthat hold for .  a new set of formulasfor the average skin-friction coefficient, over an insulatedflat plate at hypersonic speeds has been obtained .  calculationson the basis of the new formulas yield the data shown in figs.steady decrease in as increases, the present results indicatethat may increase with at hypersonic mach numbers.
