elastic stability of circular cylindrical shells stabilizedby a soft elastic core . the effect of a soft elastic core upon thebuckling strength of a thin, circular, cylindrical shell isinvestigated experimentally .  two types of loading areconsidered ..  (a) axial compression, and (b) uniform radialbandloading, where the width of the band is small comparedto the length of the shell .for each type of loading it is shown that the strengtheningeffect of the elastic core becomes more significantwith the increasing values of the radius-thickness ratio .for example, it is shown that for the geometric and elasticconstants considered it is possible, with the presenceof the core, to increase the axial buckling stress by asmuch as 65 percent over the values found for those withoutan elastic core .  the elastic core is even more effectivein stabilizing the shell against buckling due to bandloading, the peak pressure required to buckle the filledspecimen being 7.30 times that required to buckle theunfilled shell .
