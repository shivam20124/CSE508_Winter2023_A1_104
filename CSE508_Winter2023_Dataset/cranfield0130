the behaviour of non-linear systems . many of the phenomena that occur in the world around us aregoverned by nonlinear relationships .  in the development of themathematical sciences, the difficulties of nonlinear analysis havehindered the formulation of nonlinear concepts that would permitus to understand such phenomena .  in the present article,our progress in understanding the behavior of nonlinear systemsis reviewed and an attempt is made to present the resulting conceptsin such a way that they may be applied with some generalityto other problems .
