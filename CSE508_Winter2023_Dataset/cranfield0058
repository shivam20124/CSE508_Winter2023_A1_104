pressure measurements on sharp and blunt 5 and 15 half-anglecones at mach number 3.86 and angles of attack to100 . measured pressure distributions on cones are compared with modifiednewtonian theory .  deviations as large as 14 percent of the stagnationpressure behind a normal shock are found .by combining empirical resultsfor cylinders normal to the flow withnewtonian concepts, a method of calculatingpressures on cones at high anglesof attack is developed .  calculationsby this method differ from theexperimental results on sharp conesby only 2 percent of the stagnationpressure behind a normal shock .  forblunted cones, additional deviationsup to 8 percent are noted near thenose .schlieren pictures of the flow show an attached shock on the sharpof attack .  detachment of the shock appearsto be associated with theattainment of sonic speed immediatelybehind the shock .an orifice size effect is found which can increase the indicatedpressure above the true value, ifthe orifice width is greater than onetenththe local radius of curvature .
