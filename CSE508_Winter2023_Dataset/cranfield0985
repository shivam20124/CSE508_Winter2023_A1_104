a rapid approximate method for the design of hub shroud profiles ofcentrifugal impellers of given blade shape . a rapid approximate method for the design of centrifugal compressors ofgiven blade shape with compressible nonviscous flow characteristics hasbeen developed using techniques based upon stream-filament theory .axial symmetry is assumed, but meridional-plane forces derived fromtangential pressure gradients are included .the method was applied to the design of an impeller in order to determinethe approximate maximum meridional streamline spacing thatcould be used . three numerical solutions for different streamlinespacings were made using the same hub profile, blade shape, and prescribedvelocity distribution along the hub . the shroud profiles obtainedfrom the three solutions, which utilized 3, 5, and 9 streamtubes,were negligibly different . the approximate computing time requiredwas 15 hours per streamtube .
