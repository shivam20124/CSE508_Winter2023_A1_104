methods of boundary-layer control for postponing and alleviatingbuffeting and other effects of shock-induced separation . the use of boundary-layer control to increase the separation-freemargins of mach number and lift coefficient beyond the cruise point ofhigh-speed aircraft may often be preferred to design changes that impairthe cruising performance or the landing and take-off characteristics .the factors that influence the choice of method and details of its applicationare discussed, emphasising particularly the need to maintaineffectiveness over most of the chord to cover the wide range of separationpositions encountered as the shock moves over the wing with changingflight conditions .research at the national physical laboratory that has embraced highvelocityblowing, vane and air-jet vortex generators, and, in apreliminary way, distributed suction, is briefly described . therelative merits of the various methods are discussed, and some resultsachieved in their application are given .for vortex generators, the importance is stressed of the vortex pathsdetermined by the interactions of neighbouring vortices and theirimages . thus, systems of counter-rotating vortices always leave thesurface in pairs and lose their effectiveness . co-rotating systems aretherefore preferred for many applications . blowing, which in windtunneltests gives results as good as or better than vortex generatorsand does not have the disadvantage of a drag penalty at cruise, has notyet been assessed in flight . air-jet vortex generators, which wouldalso avoid the drag penalty, show promise of producing significanteffects with relatively small blowing pressures and quantities .
