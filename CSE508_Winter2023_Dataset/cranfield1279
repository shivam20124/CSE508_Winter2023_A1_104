sublimation in a hypersonic environment . a priori knowledge of the response of materials subjected to asevere aerothermal environment is essential in the space age .the successful design of space and re-entry vehicles demandsthat the fundamental problem of the interaction between a materialand dissociated air be properly formulated and solved .  inthis paper, the problem of sublimation in a hypersonic environmentis considered .in this study of hypersonic ablation, the pertinent conservationequations are derived and the simultaneous processes ofdiffusion, convection, and thermal exchange are analyzed for thevaporization of a refractory material which is subjected to theenvironmental conditions encountered during hypersonic reentry.for simplicity, only the forward stagnation point of an axiallysymmetric body is treated .  it is shown that the quantity,called the effective heat of vaporization, which includes all heatabsorbing or heat blocking effects, is an increasing function offlight speed, independent of body size, except where nonequilibriumvaporization effects or radiative effects appear .
