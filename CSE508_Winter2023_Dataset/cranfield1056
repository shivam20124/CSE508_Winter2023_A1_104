axisymmetric large deflections of circular plates subjectedto thermal and mechanical load . this paper is concerned with the nonlinear axisymmetricanalysis of circular plates with in-planeedge restraint .  both temperature and mechanicalloads are accommodated as an extension of investigationsperformed for the isothermal mechanicalloading problem .  an exact mathematical formulationwithin the framework of the v. karman largestrain-displacement relations is developed .  the equilibriumequations and boundary conditions are thenderived by utilizing the calculus of variations for arbitraryaxisymmetrical temperatures and normal distributedloading .  the satisfaction of equilibrium andcompatibility equations requires the solution of twosimultaneous nonlinear ordinary differential equationssubject to the prescribed boundary conditions .  analyticalsolutions of such equations are apparently notpossible and therefore numerical procedures must beemployed .a finite difference procedure utilizing /relaxediterations,/ developed by h. keller and e. reiss, andemployed by them for the solution of isothermal problemswith apparently unlimited load parameter ranges,is used here for combined thermo-mechanical problems .numerical results are presented for the special case ofa simply supported circular plate with radially immovableboundaries, subject to a uniform pressure and anarbitrary temperature variation through the thicknesstained for a large range of temperature and load parameters.  however, because of space limitations, onlya limited amount of data are presented in this paper .
