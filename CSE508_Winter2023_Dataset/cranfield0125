measurements of skin friction of the compressible turbulentboundary layer on a cone with foreign gas injection . measurements of average skin friction of the turbulent boundarylayer have been made on a 15 total included angle cone withforeign gas injection .  measurements of total skin-friction dragwere obtained at free-stream mach numbers of 0.3, 0.7, 3.5, andx 10 with injection of helium, air, and freon-12through the porous wall .  substantial reductions in skin frictionare realized with gas injection within the range of machnumbers of this test .  the relative reduction in skin friction isin accordance with theory--that is, the light gases are mosteffective when compared on a mass flow basis .  there is a markedeffect of mach number on the reduction of average skin friction,.this effect is not shown by the available theories .  limited transitionlocation measurements indicate that the boundary layerdoes not fully trip with gas injection but that the transition pointapproaches a forward limit with increasing injection .  the variationof the skin-friction coefficient, for the lower injection rateswith natural transition, is dependent on the flow reynolds numberand type of injected gas,. and at the high injection rates theskin friction is in fair agreement with the turbulent boundarylayerresults .
