normal-shock relations in magnetohydrodynamics . the magnetic-field vector is perpendicular to the flow direction,.thus for normal shocks there is no change of flow direction throughthe shock front .  this class of shocks is included in investigationsby several authors (five are referred to here), but the presentationhere is thought to be especially convenient .  all downstreamquantities are given in terms of upstream flow conditions,including the upstream ratio of alfven speed to sound speed, andthe shock strength (density ratio) .
