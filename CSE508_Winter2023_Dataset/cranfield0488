a reaction-rate parameter for gasdynamics of a chemicallyreacting gas mixture . presented note proposes a linearized reaction rate parameterwhich is applicable to any reacting gas mixture provided all thepertinent reactions and their rate constants are known at the thermodynamicconditions under consideration .  linearizing isachieved by expanding equation of rate of chemical reaction in ataylor series and neglecting higher-order terms .  author announcesthat tables of linearized reaction rate parameters for dissociatedand slightly ionized air are now in preparation at thespace sciences laboratory, general electric co., msvo .comparison of preliminary results with exact calculations publishedby hall, i. g., et.al., /inviscid hypersonic air-flows withcoupled non-equilibrium processes/ (ias paper 62-67, 30th annualmeeting, new york, jan. 1962) indicates good agreement .
