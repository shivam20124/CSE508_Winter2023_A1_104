research on unsteady flow . this is a survey of certain recent advances made in the studyof aerodynamic unsteady flow and of some of the new problemsarising which require further investigation .  no attempt is made toreproduce classical theory, but emphasis rather is laid on validityand general usefulness, particular attention being given to unsteadyboundary-layer effects, especially when there is flow separation.  coverage is broad and author thus provides a useful reviewfor those interested in this field .
