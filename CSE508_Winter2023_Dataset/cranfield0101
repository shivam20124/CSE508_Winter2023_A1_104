laminar heat transfer over blunt-nosed bodies at hypersonic flightspeeds . this paper deals with two limiting cases of laminar heat transfer overblunt-nosed bodies at hypersonic flight speeds, or high stagnation temperatures..(a) thermodynamic equilibrium, in which the chemical reactionrates are regarded as /very fast/ compared to the rates of diffusionacross streamlines., (b) diffusion as rate-governing, in which the volumerecombination rates within the boundary layer are /very slow/ comparedto diffusion across streamlines .  in either case the gas densitynear the surface of a blunt-nosed body is much higher than the densityjust outside the boundary layer, and the velocity and stagnation enthalpyprofiles are much less sensitive to pressure gradient than in themore familiar case of moderate temperature differences .  in fact, incase (a), the nondimensionalized enthalpy gradient at the surface isrepresented very accurately by the /classical/ zero pressure gradientvalue, and the surface heat-transfer rate distribution is obtained directlyin terms of the surface pressure distribution .  in order toillustrate the method, this solution is applied to the special casesof an unyawed hemisphere and an unyawed, blunt cone capped by a sphericalsegment .in the opposite limiting case where diffusion is rate-controlling thediffusion equation for each species is reduced to the same form as thelow-speed energy equation, except that the prandtl number is replacedby the schmidt number .  the simplifications introduced in case (a) arealso applicable here, and the expression for surface heat transfer rateis similar., the maximum value of the ratio between the rate of heattransfer by diffusion alone and by heat conduction alone in the case ofthermodynamic equilibrium is given by..  (prandtl no./schmidt no .)when the diffusion coefficient is estimated by taking a reasonable valueof atom-molecule collision cross section this ratio is 1.30 .  additionaltheoretical and (especially) experimental studies are clearly requiredbefore these simple results are accepted .
