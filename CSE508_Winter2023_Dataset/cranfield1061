turbulent mixing of a rocket exhaust jet with a supersonic stream includingchemical reactions . the equations for the turbulent mixing of a two-dimensional supersonicjet issuing into an ambient supersonic stream are formulated . bothstreams consist of a mixture of chemically active and possibly reactinggases, therefore any heat release by chemical reaction is included,. thenet mass rate of production of species is obtained on the assumptionthat the reaction rate constant is given by an expression reducible tothe classical arrhenius law . the equations first given in terms of thex, and y coordinates, are expressed in dimensionless form and in termsof the x and coordinates, where is the stream function . the resultingexpressions are all of the /heat conduction/ type,. they are put in afinite difference form by using the crank-nicolson method of substitutingfinite difference approximations for both the /time/ and /space/derivatives . the mixture is assumed to consist of six species, namelyh2o, h2, o2, co2, co, and n2, and the oxidation of h2 and co is assumedto take place according to a single-step chemical reaction . the solutionof the problem is based on the simultaneous solution of 8n linearalgebraic equations in 8n unknowns, n being the number of internal gridpoints at every step in the x-direction, and 8 the total number of unknownsat each grid point, namely velocity, temperature, and concentrationfor each of the six species . a method of obtaining initial andboundary conditions from available inviscid jet flow solutions is discussed. the equations are programed for calculation on an ibm-704 computer. finally, one typical case is considered, and plots of velocity,temperature, and concentration profiles are given for the initial stagesof development of the mixing layer .
