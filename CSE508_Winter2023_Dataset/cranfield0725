the response of a typical aircraft structure to jetnoise . an analysis is made of experimentally determined mode shapesexcited on the rear structure of a modern airliner by jet noise froma pod-mounted turbojet engine .  power spectra of stresses determinedfrom strain-gage measurements are obtained and cross correlated.  extensive measurements were made on skin panels of thefuselage and elevator and limited ones were made on fuselagestringers and frames .  the skin-panel results are compared withtheoretical predictions .  reviewer believes that this paper is ofconsiderable value for those concerned with response of aircrafttypestructures to jet-induced noise .
