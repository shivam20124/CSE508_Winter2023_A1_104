base pressure in supersonic flow . the problem of accurately predicting the pressure and wakeconfiguration at the base of bodies in supersonic flow is an extremelyimportant one inasmuch as a sizeable portion of the totaldrag of a given body may be attributable to the low pressure inthis region .  although a great deal of theoretical and experimentalwork has been done in this field, there does not yet exist a satisfactorymethod for accurate predictions .this paper represents an excellent effort to experimentally confirmanalytically deduced concepts .  a large amount of experimentaldata on body shapes such as wedges, cones, and conecylindershas been obtained over a range of mach numbers up to 4 .the data are thoroughly discussed with respect to analytical deductions.  on the basis of the evidence accumulated it is concludedthat the boundary-layer thickness has only a small effecton the base pressure for axisymmetric bodies and for twodimensionalbodies when the base height-to-chord ratios are ofthe order .reviewer believes this report is a significant contribution in thefield of base pressure and wake flow phenomena .
