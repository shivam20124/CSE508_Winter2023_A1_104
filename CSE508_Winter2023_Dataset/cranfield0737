on the analysis of elastic plates of variable thickness . the extensional and flexural equationsgoverning the elastic behaviour of a plateof variable thickness are expressed interms of the laplacian operator .  temperaturevariations in the plane of theplate and across the thickness of the plateare taken into account .general solutions are given for a rectangularplate whose thickness varies exponentiallyalong the length, and for a circular,or annular, plate whose thickness variesas a power of the radius .the large-deflexion equations, includingeffects of initial irregularities, are alsodiscussed .
