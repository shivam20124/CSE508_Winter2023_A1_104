compressive and torsional buckling of thin-wall cylindersin the yield region . based on assumptions which haveled to the best agreement betweentheory and test data on inelastic bucklingof flat plates, a general setof equilibrium differential equationsfor the plastic buckling of cylindershas been derived .  these equationshave been used to obtain solutionsfor the compressive and torsionalbuckling of long cylinders inthe yield region .test data are presented which indicatesatisfactory agreement withthe theoretical plasticity-reductionfactors in most cases .  where adifference in results exists, test dataare in substantially better agreementwith the results obtained by use ofthe maximum-shear law ratherthan the octahedral-shear law to transformaxial stress-strain data toshear stress-strain data .
