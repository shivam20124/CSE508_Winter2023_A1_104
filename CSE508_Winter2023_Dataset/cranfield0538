the conpressibility transformation and the turbulentboundary layer equations . the compressibility transformation first introduced by dorodnitzynhas been applied in this paper to the equations of the turbulentboundary layer on a flat plate, considering heat transferand arbitrary prandtl numbers .  assuming the shear distributionto be invariant under the transformation, the stream functionand the momentum equation take the proper form for incompressibleflow, allowing the use of incompressible velocityprofiles in the transformed coordinates .  application of crocco'smethod to the transformed energy equation permits integrationof the energy equation resulting in a formulism remarkablysimilar to that proposed by eckert .  finally, the reference conditionwas chosen to correspond to the edge of the sublayer fromconsiderations of the assumptions made regarding the shearstressdistribution .  with this choice, the reference enthalpy is ingood agreement with eckert's formula over the ordinary range oftest conditions .  in view of these results, the analysis may beconsidered to provide a theoretical basis for the referenceenthalpymethod .
