theoretical analysis of turbulent mixing of reactivegases with application to supersonic combustion ofhydrogen . the turbulent mixing of an axisymmetric jet of areactive gas is considered .  by assuming a convenientmodel for the compressible eddy viscosity,the momentum equation is reduced to a formamenable to approximate solution .  the resultingvelocity distribution in both incompressible andcompressible flows is in reasonable agreement withexperiment .  the usual assumptions with respectto chemical behavior, namely either frozen orequilibrium flow, and to unity lewis numbersand prandtl number are employed .  the theoreticalresults for chemical equilibrium are shownto be in reasonable agreement with experimental datafrom low speed hydrogen flames .  a numericalexample of interest in connection with a hypersonic,air breathing vehicle is carried out in detail .
