viscous compressible and incompressible flow in slenderchannels . an analytical study is made of viscous flow in slender channels.  similar solutions to the approximate equations of motion,valid for flow at moderate or high reynolds numbers in slenderchannels, are found for incompressible two-dimensional andaxisymmetric flows and for compressible flows through twodimensionalchannels with adiabatic walls .  a study of compressibleflows in convergent-divergent channels yields resultsregarding the effect of viscosity on the location of the sonic line,on the pressure ratio at the geometric throat and on the dischargecoefficient for such channels .
