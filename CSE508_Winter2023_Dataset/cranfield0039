on the flow of a sonic stream past an airfoil surface . this study of the flow about an airfoil in a near-sonic streamindicates the important factors determining the pressure distributionon the airfoil .  analysis of the mach wave patternsuggests that the supersonic domain of the flow can be derivedfrom two simple-wave flows, one arising from the mach wavesreflected at the sonic line and the other from the changes in airfoilsurface slope .  the compressive effect of the reflected machwaves is determined quantitatively as a function of airfoil leading-edgegeometry from an analysis of measured pressure distributionsfor uncambered airfoils,. and it is shown how this canbe superimposed on the wave system from the curved surface togive an equivalent simple-wave flow over the airfoil .an application of this scheme to the calculation of the pressuredistribution over an airfoil in a sonic stream gives results in goodagreement with experiment .
