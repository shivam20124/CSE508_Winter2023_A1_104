on heat transfer over a sweat-cooled surface in laminarcompressible flow with a pressure gradient . a simple expression is derived for the normal injection velocitydistribution theoretically required to maintain a given uniformtemperature along a porous surface in the laminar boundarylayerregion of a compressible flow with a given velocity distributionoutside of the boundary layer .  this expression is valid forany given free-stream mach number but is based on a prandtlnumber of unity and on the assumption that the viscosity coefficientvaries linearly with the temperature .  by using thedorodnitsyn type of transformation, the variation of fluid propertieseven in the case of zero mach number is taken into account.  this study is of particular practical interest in connectionwith the sweat-cooling of turbine blades and of airfoil surfacesin high speed flow .  the method of analysis consists of applyingthe karman-pohlhausen method to both the momentum andenergy boundary-layer equations and of using an additional heatbalance equation, involving the coolant temperature .  a closedformapproximate solution of the equations is then derived .  numericalexamples for flow in the immediate vicinity of a stagnationpoint and for a typical type of flow over a turbine blade aregiven .
