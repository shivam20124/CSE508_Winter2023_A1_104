elastic stability of orthotropic shells . a small-deflection theory for general instability of orthotropiccircular cylindrical shells has been derived for external pressure,torsion, and axial compression .  for the first two types of loading,comparison of the theory with experimental data for orthotropiccylinders reveals agreement comparable with that obtainedfor isotropic shells .  for axial compression, experimentaldata have been found to agree reasonably well with theory fororthotropic cylinders, in contrast to the agreement usually obtainedfor isotropic cylinders .
