supersonic inlet dynamics . an approximation of the differential equation for compressibleduct flow is presented .  the equation is linear and of the secondorder .  the duct transfer function and response characteristicsare obtained by applying small-perturbation theory to the differentialequation .  the resulting equations describe ductnatural frequency as a function of duct areas and volumes, anddamping ratio as a function of the slope of the steady-state massflow, pressure-recovery curve .the calcualted response agrees, to a first approximation, withmeasured response as obtained from tests of a fixed-geometry,sugar-scoop inlet model with hypass for matching airflows .  testingwas done in the 10 x 10 and 8 x 6 ft. supersonic tunnelsat nasa lewis flight propulsion laboratory .  further agreementwas obtained during flight tests of the f8u-3 airplane .
