sweepback effects in the turbulent boundary-layer shock-waveinteraction . experiments are reported on the interaction of turbulentboundary layers and shock waves with sweptback configurations .they show that the peak pressure rise at separation, the upstreaminfluence ahead of separation, and the pressure rise at reattachmentfor moderate sweep angles can all be understood bysimple extensions of available two-dimensional theories .
