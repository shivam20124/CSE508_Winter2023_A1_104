the rolling up of the trailing vortex sheet and itseffect on the downwash behind wings . the motion of the trailing vortices associated with a lifting wingis investigated by theoretical and visual-flow methods for thepurpose of determining the proper vortex distribution to be usedfor downwash calculations .  both subsonic and supersonic speedsare considered in the analysis .it is found that the degree to which the vortices are rolled updepends upon the distance behind the wing and upon the liftcoefficient, span loading, and aspect ratio of the wing .  while therolling up of the trailing vortices associated with high-aspectratiowings is of little practical importance, it is shown that, withlow-aspect-ratio wings, the trailing vortex sheet may become essentiallyrolled up into two trailing vortex cores within a chordlength of the trailing edge .the downwash fields associated with the two limiting cases ofthe flat vortex sheet and the fully rolled-up vortices are investigatedin detail for both subsonic and supersonic speeds .  theintermediate case in which the rolling-up process is only partiallycompleted at the tail position is also discussed .
