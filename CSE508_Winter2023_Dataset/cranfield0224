quasi-cylindrical surfaces with prescribed loadingsin the linearised theory of supersonic flow . a formula for the velocity field in terms of a given surface distributionof vorticity is applied to pointslying on the surface .  an equationgiving the shape of a quasi circularcylindricalsurface in terms of a prescribedloading is derived .  as anexample a half ring wing with prescribedloading is discussed .
