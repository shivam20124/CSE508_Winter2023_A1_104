new thermo-mechanical reciprocity relations with applicationto thermal stress analysis . based on the variational formulation of linear thermodynamicsas developed previously by the writer, thermomechanicalreciprocity relations are discussed which lead to new methods ofanalysis of thermal stresses .  these reciprocity relations are quitedifferent from the usual ones derived from the analogy of thermalloading with a combination of surface and body-force distribution .the results are applicable to stationary and transient temperaturesin elastic and viscoelastic structures .  the methods areentirely variational and do not require the evaluation of thetemperature field .  the stresses at one point are expressed directlyin terms of any arbitrary distribution temperatures appliedexternally, including the effect of surface heat-transfer layer .the concepts and procedures are illustrated on a simple example.  the relation is pointed out between the reciprocityproperty and the generalization of castigliano's principle tothermomechanics .
