on the prediction of mixed subsonic/supersonic pressuredistributions . high-speed wind-tunnel results are analyzed to derive a semiempiricalscheme for the prediction of transonic pressure distributions.  the supersonic and subsonic parts of the flow aretreated separately, and then linked by an empirical shock pressurerise relation .  the significance of the empirical results isconsidered in relation to the physical mechanism of transonicflows .  it is also shown that theoretical solutions can be improvedby introducing the empirical shock relation .
