hypersonic viscous flow over a sweat-cooled flat plate . this paper presents a theoretical analysis of the hypersonicviscous flow over a sweat-cooled flat plate .  the physical systemunder consideration is the hypersonic laminar boundarylayer over a porous flat plate with homogeneous, normal injectionof a coolant into the external stream .  a heat balance atthe porous surface is made between the heat transferred to thesurface and the heat absorbed by the coolant .  the existenceof similar solutions requires a nonuniform distribution of coolantinjection .  the method of solution consists of the integration ofthree simultaneous first-order equations, the momentum and theenergy integral equations in the boundary layer, and the tangentwedgeapproximation in the inviscid layer .  first-order asymptoticformulas are given in both the strong and the weak pressureinteraction regions for the induced surface pressure, the skinfrictioncoefficient, and the nusselt number .  numerical resultsfor three specific cases are presented and discussed .
