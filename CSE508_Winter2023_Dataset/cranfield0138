wakes in axial compressors . the tendency in the past has been to assume thatwhen wakes or non-uniform total head profiles arefed into an axial compressor then substantially constantstatic pressure prevails at the entry, the variations in totalhead appearing as variations in velocity .  this variationin velocity causes variation in incidence on the early stageblade rows and thus can give rise to excitation of bladevibration .  this assumption is implicit, for instance, inreferences 1 and 2, but we think has been a common assumptionby most of the people working in this field .where the compressor is fed by a duct of substantiallyparallel walls for a reasonable length ahead, such an assumptionappeared justifiable .  such a duct when givenan air flow test with its outlet discharging, for instance,to atmosphere instead of to the compressor, then the distributionassumed would normally be obtained and in factmany surveys of such ducts have been represented in thisfashion .  the object of this note is to show that, in fact,this distribution will not normally occur when the compressoris present and we may normally expect much morenearly a constant velocity into the compressor with attendantstatic pressure distributions to match with the totalhead variations ahead of the intake, with of course, theattendant curved flow to support the static pressuregradients .
