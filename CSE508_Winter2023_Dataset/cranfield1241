the turbulent boundary layer on chemically active ablatingsurfaces . incompressible turbulent-boundary-layer analysis is extrapolatedanalytically to the case of a compressible turbulentboundary layer with ablation or mass injection at the surface .the effects of chemical reactions such as dissociation and recombinationas well as combustion are included .  the analysisapplies to blunt as well as sharp bodies which are either axisymmetricor two-dimensional .  when the turbulent lewis andprandtl numbers are unity, it is found that, as in the laminarcase, little detailed knowledge of the chemistry inside the boundarylayer is required in most instances .  the conditions at thesurface and the outer edge of the boundary layer are often sufficientfor prediction of heat and mass transfer .comparison is made with experiments on the combustion ofgraphite under turbulent flow conditions .  prediction of ablationrates within about 30 percent accuracy is obtained when empiricalconstants obtained from incompressible velocity profileswith no mass injection are used .
