theoretical considerations of flutter at high machnumber . some of the theories for two-dimensional oscillatory air forceswhich may be applied in flutter calculations at high mach numbersare discussed .  these include linear theory, van dyke'ssecond-order theory, piston theory, landahl's method, tangentwedgeand tangent-cone approximations, newtonian theory, anda new nonlinear-pressure method .  a comparison of the theoriesis made by showing the results of flutter calculations for machnumbers up to 10, and the possibility of flutter at these highermach numbers is pointed out .results of flutter calculations are shown to illustrate the variouseffects arising from a nonlinear thickness theory .  the possibilityof large flutter speed thickness effects which depend on frequencyratio is shown .  the influence of airfoil shape is discussedand flutter speed trends with center of gravity and elastic axislocations are presented .  some possible refinements of pistontheory are discussed for use at very high mach numbers .  theseinclude the use of local flow conditions and the use of newtoniantheory over the leading edge of a blunt-nosed airfoil .
