note on the three-point boundary layer problem forthe blasius equations . in a recent paper a method was presented for obtaininghigher accuracy in the numerical solution of the blasiusequation with three-point boundary conditions .  the wellknownblasius equation was previously developed in an investigationof the steady two-dimensional incompressible boundarylayerflow over a flat plate, but it has been extensively used ininvestigating other fluid flow problems .  the three-pointboundary-value problem is encountered in the theory of laminarmixing and in approximate analyses of separated and wakeflows as noted in ref. 1 .
