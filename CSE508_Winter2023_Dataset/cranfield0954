analysis of stress at several junctions in pressurizedshells . theoretical and experimental results are presentedfor the discontinuity stresses arising at achange of wall thickness in a cylinder, a cylinderhemispherejunction, and a cone-spherical torusjunction in pressure vessels .  the effect of mismatchof nonconcurrence of the middle surfaces of twojoined cylinders is considered .  in addition, a cylinderwith a special closure which has considerablyreduced stresses is described, and curves with theoreticaland experimental stresses are presented .
