a method of calculating velocity distribution for turbulentboundary layers in adverse pressure distributions . a new method of calculating the behavior of turbulent boundarylayers in adverse pressure distributions is developed whichpermits direct determination of the velocity profile rather thanthe gross integral parameters normally used to infer the generalcharacter of the boundary layer .  the method offers the simplicityof algebraic equations coupled with the use of chartsrather than the laborious simultaneous solution of coupled differentialequations required by existing methods .  the method alsoary-layer thickness, thus allowing calculation of the absolute asaffords, for the first time, a means of determining the total boundwellas the nondimensional velocity distribution .the velocity profile is considered to be composed of two regions--aninner region which is described by the law of the walland an outer region which is described by a function depictingthe deviation from that law .  the deviation function involvestwo parameters which are uniquely dependent upon the skinfrictioncoefficient and a third parameter which, for practicalpurposes, can be considered a constant .  since the entire velocitydistribution was found to be almost uniquely dependentupon the local skin friction, serious doubt is cast upon the generallyaccepted /history concept/ which considers the outer regionof the boundary layer to be dependent on integrated upstreamconditions .agreement between experimental velocity distributions andthose calculated by the method presented here is generally verygood .  the analysis and calculation procedures which are presentedare applicable to two-dimensional, pseudo-two-dimensional,and axisymmetric conical flows .
