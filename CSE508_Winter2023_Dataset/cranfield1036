on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells . according to marguerre (proc. 5th internat. congressappl. mech., cambridge, mass., 1938, wiley, new york,shells are governed by three simultaneous differential equationsin the three displacements .  the author has considerablysimplified this theory for the case of transverse vibrationsby ignoring the longitudinal inertia terms, thus reducingthe problem to that of solving two simultaneousdifferential equations in a stress function and one displacementcomponent .  this simplification is justified by an orderof-magnitudeanalysis, and illustrated by considering thevibrations of a paraboloidal shell with a rectangularboundary .
