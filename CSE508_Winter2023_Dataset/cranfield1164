effect of ground proximity on the aerodynamic characteristicsof a four- engined vertical take-off and landing transportairplane model with tilting wing and propellers . an investigation has been madeto study the effect of ground proximityon the aerodynamic characteristicsof a four-engine vertical-takeoff-and-landingtransport-airplanemodel with tilting wing and propellers.  tests were made with the wingat an angle of incidence of 90,the position used for vertical take-offor landing .  with the model atvarious heights above the ground, thelift, drag, and pitching momentwere measured and tuft studies weremade to determine the flow fieldcaused by the propeller slipstream .data were obtained for the completemodel, for the model with horizontaltail removed, and for the wingpropellercombination alone .the results of the investigationshowed that, when the model washovering near the ground, there was astrong upwash in the plane ofsymmetry and also an increase in liftof about 10 percent of the propellerthrust .  about one-half of thislift resulted from an increasein propeller thrust and one-half resultedfrom an up load on the fuselageinduced by the upwash .  as the modelapproached the ground, it alsoexperienced an increasing nose-downpitching moment that evidentlyresulted from the up load on the fuselage,the rear part of which waslonger than the front part .  the additionof the horizontal tail whichwas located about halfway up the verticaltail did not increase thenose-down pitching moment because thefuselage decreased the energy ofthe upwash before it reached the tail .
