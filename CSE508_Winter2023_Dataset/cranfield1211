boundary layer transition at supersonic speedsthree-dimensionalroughness effects (spheres). further experiments carried out in the 12-in. supersonic windtunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the california instituteof technology to investigate the effect of three-dimensionalroughness elements (spheres) on boundary-layer transition on athe local mach number for these tests was 2.71 .  the data showclearly that the minimum (effective) size of trip required to bringtransition to its lowest reynolds number varies as the one-fourthpower of the distance from the apex of the cone to the trip .  useof available data for other mach numbers indicates that themach-number influence for effective tripping is taken into accountby the simple expression .some remarks concerning the roughness variationfor transition on a blunt body are made .
