on local flat plate similarity in the hypersonic boundarylayer . a study is made of lees' /local flat-plate similarity/ rule forthe hypersonic laminar boundary layer .  it is shown that thisrule is exact under assumptions commonly invoked in the inviscidtheory of hypersonic flow .beginning from this theoretical basis, a modified local flatplatesimilarity scheme is derived, involving separate rules forvelocity and enthalpy profiles, and is compared with exact similaritysolutions and with the existing theory of hypersonic leading-edgeinteraction .
