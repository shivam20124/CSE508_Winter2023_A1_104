generalised-newtonian theory . author generalizes lees's (amr 10(1957), rev. 2601) modificationof newtonian theory for blunt-nose bodies to apply to pointednosebodies as well .  the result is expressed bysin where is the local inclination of the body surfaceand the subscript /max/ refers to the maximum local inclinationand pressure coefficient .  for blunt-nose bodiesand the generalized theory reverts to lees's blunt-nose modificationwith given by normal shock relations .  author shows,by comparison of newtonian and generalized-newtonian theorywith exact solutions, the superiority of generalized-newtoniantheory .  he also shows that both two-dimensional and axisymmetricshapes are correlated by this generalization .  results arepresented in two figures that support author's generalization andindicate the independence of the correlation from variations inboth the hypersonic similarity parameter k = m(d1) and the ratioof specific heats y .reviewer believes this generalization should be of interest tothose engaged in development of hypersonic hardware as well astheory .
