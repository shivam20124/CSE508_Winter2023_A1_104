an investigation of optimum zoom climb techniques . the problem of optimal zoom climb maneuvering of a turbojetaircraft has been investigated using the mayer formulation of thecalculus of variations .  the euler-lagrange equations governingoptimum symmetric flight have been integrated numerically bydigital computation .discontinuities in thrust arising from turbojet afterburnerblowout have been treated, and conditions which must be satisfiedacross the interface generated by the discontinuity have beenderived .arbitrary control techniques have been compared with theoptimum, and it has been found that performance is relativelyinsensitive to piloting technique unless a time limitation is imposedwhich requires high maneuvering load factors .
