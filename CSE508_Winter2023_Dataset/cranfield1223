inviscid-incompressible-flow theory of static two-dimensionalsolid jets, in proximity to the ground . the inviscid-incompressible-flow theory of static two-dimensionalsolid jets impinging orthogonally on the ground is presentedusing conformal mapping methods .it is shown that the thrust of a solid jet at constant powerinitially decreases as the ground is approached .  the magnitudeof the thrust out of ground effect is regained only at a verylow height-to-jet width ratio (approximately 0.55) .  the maximuindecrease is about 6 percent .  the ground effect on solidjets is thus largely unfavorable .
