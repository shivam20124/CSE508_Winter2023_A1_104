extension of boundary layer separation criteria toa m=6 .5 utilizing flat plates with forward-facingsteps . an experimental investigation hasbeen made of the separation phenomenaon a flat plate to which forwardfacingsteps were attached toforce separation .  both laminar andturbulent flows were investigatedover a mach number range of approximatelydistributions, shadowgraph and chemicalfilm techniques, the pressurerise at separation, the laminar plateaupressure, and the turbulentpeak pressure were determined .  boundarylayersurveys were made on asmooth flat plate and on a flat plate withroughness to force transition.  examinations of the separated flowshowed that the predominantvariable in the determination of the pressuredistribution was the locationof transition relative to the separationpoint and reattachment .pure laminar, transitional, and turbulenttypes of separation were foundin this mach number range .  the peak staticpressure-riseratios foridentical forward-facing steps at a machnumber of 6.25 were approximately1.5 and 5.0, respectively, for purelaminar and turbulent separation.  the effect of reynolds number on thepeak pressure rise for turbulentseparation for the lower mach numberrange was found to be veryminor provided the step height was of theorder of the boundary-layerthickness .  as the mach number is increased,the peak pressure coefficientfor turbulent separation decreasedfrom approximately 0.18at a mach number of 4 to about 0.13 at a machnumber of 6.25 .  the pressurecoefficient at the separation point forlaminar separation decreasesfrom approximately 0.014 at a mach number ofvalue at a mach number of 6.5 .  the resultsobtained with forward-facingsteps agree with the trends predicted, basedupon lower mach numberstudies .
