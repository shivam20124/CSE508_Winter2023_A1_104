stagnation point heat transfer measurements in dissociatedair . the results of an experimental investigation of the laminar heattransfer at the stagnation point of a blunt body in partially dissociatedair are presented and are compared to the theoreticaltreatment of fay and riddell .  heat-transfer results are presentedfor air temperatures as high as 8,000 k. where more thanperiments were performed in a shock tube and the new experimentaltechniques and principles are discussed briefly .  simulationof flight stagnation conditions at velocities up to satellite velocityof 26,000 ft. sec. is shown to be possible in shock tubes anddata has been obtained over a large altitude range at these velocities.
