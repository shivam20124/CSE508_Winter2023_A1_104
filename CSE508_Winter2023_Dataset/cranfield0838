bending and compression tests of pressurised ring-stiffenedcylinders . the results of tests on pressurized ring-stiffened cylinders subjectedto compression and bending are presented and discussed .  theresults obtained at high values of internal pressure differ from thoseobtained by previous investigators in that the theoretical smalldeflectioncompressive buckling coefficient of 0.6 was nearly achievedin each test .  small amounts of internal pressure had a greater stabilizingeffect in the bending tests than in the compression tests .
