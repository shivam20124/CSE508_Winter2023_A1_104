the divergence of supersonic wings including chordwisebending . the static aeroelastic stability or divergence problem is investigatedfor thin supersonic wings when not only the spanwisebending and twist are taken into account but also the chordwisebending .  the problem is treated in successive phases of increasingcomplexity from the two-dimensional curling-up of theleading edge to the three-dimensional stability of the cantileverwing .  several methods of approach are developed includingthe nonlinear aspects of the structure and the aerodynamics .results indicate a strong dependence of stability on poisson'sratio and the magnitude of the deformation .
