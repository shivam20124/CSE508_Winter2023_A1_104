supersonic airfoil performance with small heat addition . an analytical method is presented which permits a very rapidevaluation of the acrodynamic effects arising from the additionof small amounts of heat near supersonic two-dimensional airfoils.  this method applies to shockless inviscid flow without heatconduction .  also, the mechanism by which the sesired heataddition is achieved is not considered .it is shown that even small amounts of heat generate a substantialpressure rise and thus cause appreciable changes in theacrodynamic coefficients .  the results of this analysis comparefavorably with those obtained by a more accurate, but also moretedious, graphical method of characteristics .two possible modes of application to an airplane design areconsidered from the energy requirements standpoint .  in thisconnection, it is shown that the decrease of the required wingarea resulting from heat addition may, in some cases, lead tosavings in the rate of the fuel consumption .  in general, however,one should not expect any substantial reduction in energy requirementsresulting from the application of the wing heat addition.
