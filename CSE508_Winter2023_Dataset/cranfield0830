nonlinear deflections of shallow spherical shells . the equations obtained by chien for the nonlinear deflectionof shallow spherical shells under uniform external pressure aresolved by means of power series expansions, following proceduresintroduced by friedrichs and stoker in their treatment of bucklingof circular plates .  these equations depend upon two parameters.  one of these parameters is related to the external pressure,while the other depends upon the dimensions of the shell .the equations are solved for several ranges of the parametersunder boundary conditions corresponding to a fixed edge .the solution, carried out numerically on the aec univacat new york university, yields a complete description of thestresses and deflections as functions of the polar angle over awide range of values of the loading parameter and the dimensionalparameter .  prediction of the upper buckling load is thenmade by means of a numerical criterion based on the load vs.deflection curve .  for some cases, the postbuckling behavioris investigated .  the results agree well with existing experimentaland theoretical studies and cover a wide range of casesnot previously treated .
