a simple method of matric structural analysis, partiv, non-linear problems . the method presented in the previous parts is employed tosolve various kinds of nonlinear problems, such as problems concerninglarge deflections or buckling, or thermal creep, or inelasticstress redistribution involving thermal gradients, or design.  the procedure used in each case is one of direct iteration-i.e., after one assumes a starting point all subsequent cycles areself-generating .  simple numerical examples are worked out .
