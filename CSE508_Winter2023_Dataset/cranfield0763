effects of internal pressure on the buckling of circular-cylindricalshells under bending. the effect of internal pressure on the small-deflection bucklingof thin-walled cylinders under bending is investigated by meansof a modified donnell equation .  the results indicate that themaximum critical stress due to bending increases with internalpressure, unlike the case of pressurized cylinders under compression.  these results represent the moment at which significantdeformations appear in the cylinder, rather than the maximummoment able to be carried, but may be a good approximationto the latter for metal cylinders .
