note on creep buckling of columns . some general topics in elastic stability are discussed .  inparticular, attention is given to the relationship between adjacentequilibrium-positionand energy techniques, to the effects of nonlinearity,and to the sensitivity of certain stability problems to thecharacter of the loading .
