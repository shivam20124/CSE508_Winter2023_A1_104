pressure-gradient effects on the preston tube in supersonicflow . this paper is concerned with an experimental investigation ofthe effects of a longitudinal pressure gradient in a supersonicstream of air over a bounding surface on the performance of apreston or impact-pressure tube at the surface .  evidence is presentedwhich indicates that for the mach number considered andfor the range of pressure gradients covered, the preston tube functionsin a completely satisfactory manner for the determinationof local shear stress .
