some results on buckling and postbuckling of cylindricalshells . in this summary paper, theeffects of initial deformations on thebuckling and postbuckling characteristicsof circular cylindricalshells under hydrostatic pressureis determined in an approximate manner.  the influence of initialaxisymmetric deformations is stressed .also, the classical buckling ofan axially compressed, noncircularthe results show that the majorminoraxis ratio of the cross sectionhas a marked effect on thecritical load, and that use of themaximum radius of curvature in theformula for the classical bucklingstress of a circular cylindricalshell leads to good results for moderateeccentricities .
