a generalised porous-wall ?couette type? flow . recently, it was observed that the two existing boundarylayertexts (references 1 and 2) did not contain a solutionfor the case of couette flow with a constant, uniformly distributedsuction or blowing .  thus, the following analysis considersa /couette-type/ flow between a stationary flat surface anda slightly inclined flat plate moving at a constant velocity .  inaddition, the flow is subjected to a constant, uniformly distributedsuction or blowing at the fixed surface .
