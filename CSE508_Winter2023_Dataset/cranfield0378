engineering relations for friction and heat transfer to surfaces in highvelocity flow . in calculations of thermodynamic heating for high speed missiles parametershave been used based on relationships which hold for constantpropertyfluids . the validity of this procedure has been verifiedrecently in a survey of heat transfer in which a relationship for thereference temperature was developed . a calculation procedure forlaminar and turbulent boundary layers, based on this relationship, isgiven .
