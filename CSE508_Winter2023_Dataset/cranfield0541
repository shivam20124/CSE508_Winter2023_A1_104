similitude of hypersonic flows over slender bodiesin non-equilibrium dissociated gases . this paper is concerned with the similitude lawsgoverning inviscid, nonequilibrium gas flowsaround blunt or sharp-nosed slender bodies atzero angle of attack, based on the hypersonicsmall disturbance flow theory .  some relatedfeatures of the interaction between the effects ofnose bluntness and nonequilibrium dissociationand vibration and the influence of a dissociatedfreestream are also discussed .  thehypersonic equivalence principle and the relatedsimilitude for affinely related bodies are setforth for nonequilibrium flows in either diatomicgases or a gas mixture such as air .  for a familyof diatomic gases, as opposed to a given gassuch as air, a generalized ambient gas statescaling condition is obtained, whereby the ambientdensity and temperature need not besimulated .  a detailed discussion is given ofblunted cylinders and slabs or sharp-nosedcones and wedges, including example nonequilibriumflow field correlations of numericalsolutions available in the literature .  low densitynonequilibrium flows with a negligible shocklayer atom recombination rate are also examined,. as expected, a less restrictive smalldisturbance similitude law is obtained in thiscase .
