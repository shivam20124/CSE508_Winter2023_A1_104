magnetohydrodynamic mach cones . features of the surfaces of main disturbance created by a smallobject in steady motion through a conducting fluid are examined .these surfaces are found by drawing tangent cones from theobject to the relevant wave-front diagrams .  the outer wavecone (when present) is smooth, but the two inner cones havecross sections similar to the cusped figures of the inner wavefrontdiagram .  it is conjectured that the disturbance may beconcentrated along such line cusps .  this has particular relevancein the application of known two-dimensional results tothree-dimensional problems, say in the well-known techniquesof aerodynamics .  in mhd the omission of the large disturbancecharacteristics implicit in a two-dimensional solution may invalidateits use in any practical three-dimensional problem .
