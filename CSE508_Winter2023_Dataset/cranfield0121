a theory for base pressures in transonic and supersonicflow . a physical flow model is devised based on the concepts ofinteraction between the dissipative shear flow and the adjacentfree stream and the conservation of mass in thewake .  four flow components are integrated in the model,.namely, the flow approaching the trailing edge, the expansionaround the trailing edge, the mixing within thefree-jet boundary, and the recompression at the end of thewake .  a unique and stable solution results for the basepressure .  theoretical results obtained for thin approachingboundary layer do not require empirical informationand are, therefore, best suited to evaluate the merits of thetheory .  here emphasized is the case of isoenergetic constant-pressuremixing in the turbulent free-jet boundaryand agreement is found between theory and experimentaldata .
