growth of the turbulent wake behind a supersonic sphere . experimental data are presented on the growthof turbulent wakes up to 8000 calibers behindand spheres traveling at supersonicvelocities .  experimental determinationof the exponential coefficient in the growth law isvery difficult, if not impossible .  data arepresented in the form of both .in the representation, two regionsof different wake growths are observed .by means of a quasi-steady state assumption,the effect of drag deceleration is eliminatedand growth of the far wake compared with theoreticalpredictions .  the agreement with thelees-hromas theory in this region was found tobe quite good .
