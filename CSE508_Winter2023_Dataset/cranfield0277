study of flow conditions and deflection angle at exitof two-dimensional cascade of turbine rotor bladesat critical and supercritical pressure ratios . an analysis was made of the flow conditions downstream of acascade of turbine rotor blades at critical and supercritical pressureratios .  the results of five theoretical methods for determiningthe deflection angle are compared with those of an experimentalmethod using the conservation-of-momentum principle and staticpressuresurveys, and also are compared with an analysis of schlierenphotographs of the flow downstream of the blades .  a twodimensionalcascade of six blades with an axial width of 1.80 incheswas used for the static-pressure surveys and for some of the schlierenphotographs .  in order to determine the flow conditions severalblade chords downstream of the cascade, schlieren photographs weretaken of the flow through a cascade of 18 blades having an axialwidth of 0.60 inch .for the blade design studied, even at static-to-total pressureratios considerably lower than that required to give critical velocityat the throat section, the flow was deflected in the tangentialdirection as predicted for the incompressible case .  as the pressureratio was lowered further, the aerodynamic loading of the rear portionof the blade reached a maximum value and remained constant .after this condition was attained, the expansion downstream of thecascade took place with a constant tangential velocity so that nofurther increase in the amount of turning across the blade row andno further increase in the loading of the blade was available .
