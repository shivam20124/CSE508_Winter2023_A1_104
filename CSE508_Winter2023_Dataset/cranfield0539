local heat transfer to a yawed, infite, circular cylinderin laminar compressible flow . this note presents a simplification of a method for calculatingthe ratio of local to stagnation-line heat-transfer coefficientson a yawed, infinite, circular cylinder in laminar compressibleflow .  a brief description of the method of ref. 1 ispresented, followed by a discussion of the assumptions and mathematicalprocedure which lead to a considerable simplification .
