some aerodynamic considerations of nozzle afterbodycombination . the aerodynamic problems associated with propulsion-systeminstallations have assumed a roleof vital importance in the development of supersonicaircraft .  although air-induction systems have receivedmoderate attention in the literature, considerably lessinformation can be found on the design and installationof turbojet exit nozzles .  this condition should not beinterpreted to indicate a lack of problems in jet-exitdesign .as flight speeds reach supersonic levels, it becomesincreasingly difficult to achieve nozzle installationswhich are efficient over the entire speed range .  thedifficulties largely stem from the fact that the goals ofhigh jet thrust and low afterbody drag are not alwayscompatible .  in many of the compromise solutions, itis generally unsatisfactory to examine isolated nozzleand afterbody performance .  rather they must betreated as a unit, and the complex effects of jet interactionwith the external stream must be taken intoaccount .  to accomplish this, the nozzle and air-framedesigners must closely coordinate their efforts .some of the aerodynamic problems of nozzle-afterbodycombinations are outlined in this report .  particularattention is devoted to the influence of the jetstreaminteraction on both nozzle thrust and afterbodydrag .  for this purpose, use is made of shockboundary-layer-interactionconcepts .  this approach,although not precise, correctly predicts many trendsand is generally enlightening .
