on some fourier transforms in the theory of non-stationaryflows . the growth of lift on a airfoilstarting impulsively from rest to a uniform velocityhas been given by wagner (1925) .  thesteady-state lift due to circulation on an airfoiloscillating sinusoidally and moving withuniform velocity has been given by theodorsenthe present paper based essentially on thematerial of n. a. c. a. report no. 629 by theauthor, discusses some reciprocal relations ofthe nature of fourier transforms existing betweenthe functions of wagner and theodorsen .kussner (1936) has already shown that wagner'sfunction may be derived from theodorsen's function.  by means of a superposition principle itis possible to utilize these fundamental functionsto treat general problems in transientexpression which is accurate to within 2 percentis given for wagner's function .  this expressionleads to a good approximate expressionfor theodorsen's function in terms of the exponentialintegral, instead of hankel functions .an analogy is drawn between transient hydrodynamicflows and transient electrical flows .kussner (1936) has introduced a functiondescribing the growth of lift on an airfoil enteringa sharp edged vertical gust region .  thisfunction bears a certain relation to wagner'sfunction which is briefly discussed .
