viscous hypersonic similitude . an extension of classical hypersonic similitude is developedwhich takes into account the interaction effect of the displacementthickness of the boundary layer .  a basic result of thisviscous similitude is that the total drag including frictional dragobeys the classical similarity law for the pressure drag .  additionalsimilarity conditions governing viscous effects must beimposed in this similitude .underlying the similitude is a new hypersonic boundary-layerindependence principle .  according to this principle, the principalpart of a hypersonic boundary layer with given pressureand wall temperature distributions and free-stream total enthalpyis independent of the (high) external mach number distributionoutside the boundary layer .various features of viscous hypersonic similitudes are discussed.  it is found, for example, that it applies to three-dimensionalboundary-layer interaction effects on flat bodies, providedthe concepts of strip theory may be applied, and provided theaspect ratio is an invariant .
