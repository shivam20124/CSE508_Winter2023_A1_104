the problem of aerodynamic heating . paper is a good review of knowledge to date on convective heattransfer to objects moving through air at low and high speeds .theoretical and experimental information is given on recovery factorsand heat-transfer coefficients for isothermal surfaces of unsweptflat plates, wedges and cones with attached shock waves,and stagnation points of blunt bodies of revolution, for both laminarand turbulent boundary layers .  a convenient nomograph forcalculating flat plate turbulent boundary-layer heat-transfer coefficientsis given .  effects of surface cooling, surface roughness,and supply stream turbulence on transition are discussed andshown graphically .
