plastic stability theory of geometrically orthotropicplates and cylindrical shells . a linear eighth-order equilibrium differential equation forplastic buckling of geometrically orthotropic thin cylindricalshells is derived .  this equation is used to obtain explicit solutionsfor long flat plates and wide columns under axial compressionand moderate-length cylinders under external pressure, torsion,and axial compression .
