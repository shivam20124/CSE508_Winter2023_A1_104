tip-bluntness effects on cone pressures at m=6.85. there is, at present, considerable interest in the characteristiesof blunted bodies from both an aerodynamic and aheat-transfer standpoint .  the use of blunt shapes is contemplatedto reduce the heat-transfer problem at body noses, butthere are also applications for blunt noses which occur frommainly aerodynamic considerations .  an actual reduction indrag may be the beneficial result of blunting the nose of a coneor a similar slender shape under certain conditions .  althoughthe sphere has received considerable treatment, the nose shapesare not necessarily tangent spheres .  in the case, let us say, of atotal head tube situated in the nose of a given body, the bluntingmay be quite flat, and nose sections blunter than spherical shapemay conceivably be desirable, in some cases, from the heattransferstandpoint .the purpose of the present investigation is to examine theaerodynamic effect of a simple type of nose blunting on a basicbody .the incompressible flow of an electrically conducting fluidpast a porous plate y = 0 with constant suction velocity inthe presence of a transverse uniform strength has recentlybeen investigated by gupta .  in this note, the problem is generalizedto take into account the effect of free convection, when abody force g per unit mass is acting in the negative x-directionparallel to the wall .  the fluid is assumed to be semi-incompressibleas usual .  in addition to the obvious practical significance,this problem is also interesting in the sense that it providesanother exact solution of the magnetohydrodynamicequations, since the only electromagnetic assumptions involvedare constant properties and freedom from excessive charges .
