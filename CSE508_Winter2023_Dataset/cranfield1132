general instability of ring stiffened cylindrical shellssubject to external hydrostatic pressure - a comparisonof theory and experiment . tests are described of a number of machined-stiffened cylinderssubjected to external hydrostatic pressure, and the observedgeneral instability strengths compared with predictionsfrom theories of kendrick and nash .  agreement with kendrickwas found rather good .  results also are presented from electricalstrain gages which show in detail the growth of embryoniclobes and nonlinear characteristics of deformation at the thresholdof buckling .  weakening effects of imperfect circularity arediscussed .
