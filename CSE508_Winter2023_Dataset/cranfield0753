development of a quasi-steady approach to flutter andcorrelation with kernel-function results . the quasi-steady approach to flutter utilizes experimental ortheoretical steady-state aerodynamic data to arrive at increasedunderstanding of the flutter mechanism, and also, in many cases,acceptably accurate quantitative flutter predictions .  circulationlag effects are neglected, but aerodynamic damping is includedin the evaluation of the air forces .  situations requiringthe inclusion of rate aerodynamics for accurate flutter estimationare specified .a quasi-unsteady approach is also discussed, in which theapproximate magnitude of the circulation lag function at flutteris included in simple modifications of quasi-steady parameters .closed-form solutions are derived for the flutter characteristicsof a typical section with and without rate aerodynamics .  applicationis then made to the rational flutter analysis of threedimensionalmulti-degree-of-freedom lifting surfaces .a specific planform is evaluated in the mach-number rangefrom zero to two .  quasi-steady, quasi-unsteady, and kernelfunctionresults are compared subsonically .  quasi-steady resultsare utilized supersonically .primary applications of the quasi-steady approach are in theareas of preliminary design and parameter-variation studies,modification of more sophisticated flutter theories to force compatibilitywith available steady-state data, and flutter evaluationof complex configurations which can be rationally analyzed bysteady-state aerodynamic theories, but for which no completeunsteady aerodynamic theories are presently available .
