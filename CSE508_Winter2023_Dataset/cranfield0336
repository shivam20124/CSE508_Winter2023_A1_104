simplified laminar boundary layer calculations forbodies of revolution and for yawed wings . since the introduction of momentum methods in boundarylayercalculations by von karman and pohlhausen, many improvementshave been proposed .  an especially simple solutionreduces the problem to a quadrature .  here, it is proposed to extendthese methods to elementary three-dimensional cases and tocompressible laminar boundary-layer calculations .  for comparison,the corresponding problems for the turbulent boundarylayer are also discussed briefly .
