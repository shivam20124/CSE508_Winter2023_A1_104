on convective motion of a conducting fluid betweenparallel vertical plates in a magnetic field . stationary convective motion of a conducting fluidbetween vertical parallel plates in a magneticfield is considered .  an exact solution of themagnetohydrodynamic equations is obtainedfor the case of a constant vertical temperaturegradient .  the critical value of grasshof'snumber is determined for the case when thetemperature of both plates is the same .
