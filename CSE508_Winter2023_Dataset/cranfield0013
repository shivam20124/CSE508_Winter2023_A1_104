similarity laws for stressing heated wings . it will be shown that the differential equations for a heatedplate with large temperature gradient and for a similar plate atconstant temperature can be made the same by a proper modificationof the thickness and the loading for the isothermal plate .this fact leads to the result that the stresses in the heated platecan be calculated from measured strains on the unheated plate bya series of relations, called the /similarity laws ./  the applicationof this analog theory to solid wings under aerodynamic heatingis discussed in detail .  the loading on the unheated analogwing is, however, complicated and involves the novel conceptof feedback and /body force/ loading .  the problem of stressinga heated box-wing structure can be solved by the same analogmethod and is briefly discussed .
