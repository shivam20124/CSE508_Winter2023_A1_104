rocket propulsion systems for interplanetary flight . a comparison is made of several different propulsion systems for interplanetaryflight . liquid and solid propellant rockets, propulsion systemswhich use nuclear energy sources, are heating rockets, magnetoplasmadevices, ion rocket propulsion, solar heating rockets, and solarsails are briefly described and their current status reviewed . engineperformance requirements for different interplanetary missions are established. these several propulsion systems are then compared on thebasis of several performance criteria, environmental characteristics,vehicle requirements, reliability, current status, growth potential, andefficiency . predictions on various propulsion system capabilities andan analysis of multiple rocket engine reliability is included . it isconcluded that electrical rockets are superior for long-time interplanetaryflight applications, and that chemical rockets are satisfactoryfor most of the immediate applications in /near/ space . none ofthe several propulsion schemes discussed can be rejected until furthertechnical work has been accomplished .
