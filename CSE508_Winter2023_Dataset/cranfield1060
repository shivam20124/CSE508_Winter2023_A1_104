buckled states of circular plates . authors discuss the thin elastic circular disk of constant thicknesssubjected to a constant compressive thrust applied at itsedge .  the analysis presented is based upon the nonlinear vonkarman equations of plate theory and is applied to disks with completelyclamped and completely, simply supported edges .
