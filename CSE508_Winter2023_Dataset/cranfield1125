collapse by instability of thin cylindrical shellsunder external pressure . this paper discusses the collapse by instability of thinwalledcylindrical vessels subjected to external pressure .the most important of the theoretical and empiricalformulas that apply to this subject are presented in a commonnotation .  a new and simple instability formula isdeveloped .three classes of tubes are considered ..  tubes of infinitelength,. tubes of finite length with uniform radial pressureonly,. and tubes of finite length with both uniformradial and axial pressure .  collapsing pressures calculatedby the various formulas are presented in tabularform as a means of comparing the formulas .the formulas are discussed briefly and checked againstthe results of tests conducted at the u. s. experimentalmodel basin for the bureau of construction and repair,navy department .this paper is a sequel to one previously published as apart of the work of the a.s.m.e. special research committeeon the strength of vessels under external pressure .
