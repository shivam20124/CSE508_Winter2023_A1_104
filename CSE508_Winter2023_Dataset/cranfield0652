pressure distribution on two dimensional wings nearthe ground . a simple method of calculatingthe pressure distribution in incompressibleflow on two-dimensional aerofoilsof arbitrary section at moderate distancesfrom the ground is developed .comparisons with an /exact/ potentialflow solution, and with measurementson a 10 thick aerofoil of rae.101section, provide a satisfactoryverification of the adequacy of the method ,.but it is shown that it is necessaryto take account of the boundary layeron the aerofoil in the calculations .
