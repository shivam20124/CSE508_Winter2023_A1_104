heat transfer by laminar flow to a rotating plate . an exact solution of the heat-transfer problem for the vonkarman example of the laminar flow of a viscous fluid over arotating plate is given in dimensionless form and physically discussed.  the solution is explicitly given for a constant temperatureon the plate with viscous dissipation included .  the numericalresults are given for prandtl numbers from 0.5 to 10 .
