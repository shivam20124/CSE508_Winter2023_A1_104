compressible laminar flow and heat transfer about arotating isothermal disk . the flow and heat transfer about a rotating isothermal disk are reexaminedto include the effects of compressibility and property variations.  if viscous dissipation is neglected,the compressible problem iscorrelated to the incompressible problem by assuming linear variationsof viscosity and thermal conductivity with temperature .  certain inaccuraciesin several previous incompressible solutions are noted andcorrected herein .  the effect of compressibility appears as adistortion of the normal coordinate and normal velocity component and asa multiplicative factor in the heat-transfer coefficient, the nusseltnumber, and in the expressions for the skin-friction components andtorque required to rotate the disk .
