the boundary layer near the stagnation point in hypersonicflow past a sphere . flow properties behind shock waves caused by bluff bodiestraveling at supersonic speeds are of major importance in missileand high-speed aircraft design .  paper presents a mathematical solutionfor the laminar boundary layer near the stagnation point of asphere .  surface temperature is free-stream static and shock isstrong .  air is assumed calorically and thermally perfect with aprandtl number of 0.72 and a dynamic viscosity directly proportionalto temperature .based on work of homann (zamm 16, p. 153, 1936) and lighthillsimultaneous differential equations for the velocity and temperatureprofiles .  these are solved by numerical integration along anormal to the surface using a digital computer .  results are presentedas functions of free-stream mach number, reynoldsnumber, and specific heat ratio .  as increases, boundarylayerthickness is shown to decrease while shock stand-off distanceincreases .  stand-off distance also decreases with increasingand decreasing specific heat .  for constant and specificheat ratio, the product of skin-friction coefficient and the squareroot of decreases with increasing only approaching a constantvalue at greater than 10,000 .reviewer's comment is concerned with the perfect gas assumptionfor air .  author suggests that the effects of dissociation onflow properties are accounted for by a proper choice of specificheat ratio .  a consideration of the kinetics of chemical reaction inthe cooled boundary layer emphasizes the oversimplification ofthis approach .  the effect on transport properties could have beenapproximated in present analysis by changing the prandtl numberto one more representative of the existing pressures and temperatures.
