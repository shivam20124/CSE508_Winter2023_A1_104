on shearing flow between porous coaxial cylinders . the flow between concentric porous cylinders in relative axialmotion with a pressure gradient is considered .  the analysis isrestricted by the assumption that the velocity distribution is afunction of the radial coordinate only so that there is no net injectionor withdrawal of fluid at any station .  this assumption reducesthe problem to a soluble system of ordinary differentialequations .  an associated heat-transfer problem is also discussedbriefly .
