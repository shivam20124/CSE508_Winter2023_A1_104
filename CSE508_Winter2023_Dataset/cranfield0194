general theory of airfoil sections having arbitraryshape or pressure distribution . in this report a theory of thin airfoils of small camber isdeveloped which permits either the velocity distribution correspondingto a given airfoil shape, or the airfoil shape correspondingto a given velocity distribution to be calculated .  theprocedures to be employed in these calculations are outlined andillustrated with suitable examples .
