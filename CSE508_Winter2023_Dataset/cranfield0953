vibrations of infinitely long cylindrical shells underinitial stress . the general bending theory of shells under the influence ofinitial stress presented recently by herrmann and armenakasis applied in this investigation to study the effect of initial uniformcircumferential stress, uniform bending moment and uniformradial shear on the dynamic response of an infinitely longcylindrical shell .
