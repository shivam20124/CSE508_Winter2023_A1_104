heat flow in composite slabs . this paper presents the solution of the heat flow problemin composite walls under heat transfer conditionswhich are typical of uncooled rocket engine walls .  analyticexpressions in the form of fourier sums are obtainedfor the temperature distribution in a composite wall consistingof an inner (refractory) medium and an outer (metallic)medium under newtonian heat transfer into thefirst medium with negligible heat transfer from thesecond medium to the exterior .  the expressions obtainedare based on a plane parallel composite slab as a representativemodel for relatively thin cylindrical walls, withthickness-to-radius ratio not exceeding 0.2 .  the generalresults for the composite slab are simplified for the limitingcases of a thin refractory shield with a thick shielded mediumand a thick refractory shield with a thin shieldedmedium .
