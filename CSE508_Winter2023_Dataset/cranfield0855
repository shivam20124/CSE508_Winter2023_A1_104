simplified formulas for boundary value problems ofthe thin-- walled circular cylinder . n. j. hoff has presented formulas which can be used inthe solution of boundary-value problems of circularcylinders .  the purpose of this note is to express these resultsin exact simplified form,. a more detailed investigationappears elsewhere .  the notation will be that ofhoff unless otherwise stated .
