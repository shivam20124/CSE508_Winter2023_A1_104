the stability of thin-walled unstiffened circular cylindersunder axial compression including the effects of internalpressure . in the design of high-speed aircraft the importance of unpressurizedand pressurized monocoque cylinders necessitates a reliableanalysis procedure for the compressive buckling of cylindricalshells .  analysis by the classical small-deflection theory hasproved inadequate .  recent large-deflection theoretical treatmentsof the problem have shown reasonable correlation withexperiments but require a prior knowledge of the initial imperfectionsof the cylinder .  developed in this paper is a semiempiricalprocedure which permits a compressive buckling analysis ofcylindrical shells with a knowledge of the cylinder geometry only .this analysis is achieved by correlating experimental data statisticallywith theoretical parameters .in order to provide data not previously available, an extensiveseries of axial compression tests of pressurized cylinders has beenperformed .  these data, together with all other known test data,are analyzed semiempirically .  in the analysis best-fit curvesare presented using theoretical parameters and shapes of curveswhere applicable .  unpressurized and pressurized cylindercompressive buckling curves are then developed as 90 per centprobability curves from the test data .  in general, these statisticallydefined design curves are significantly lower than previouslyavailable design curves .
