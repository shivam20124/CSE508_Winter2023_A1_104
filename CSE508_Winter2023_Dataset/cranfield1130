handbook of structural stability . pt .vi . strengthof stiffened curved plates and shells . a comprehensive review of failureof stiffened curved plates andshells is presented .panel instability in stiffenedcurved plates and general instabilityof stiffened cylinders are discussed .the loadings considered for theplates are axial, shear, and thecombination of the two .  for the cylinders,bending, external pressure,torsion, transverse shear, and combinationsof these loads are considered .general instability in stiffenedcylinders was investigated .  forbending and torsion loads, test dataand theory were correlated .  forexternal pressure several existingtheories were compared .  as a resultof this investigation a unified theoreticalapproach to analysis of generalinstability in stiffened cylinderswas developed .
