some notes for the small disturbance linear theoryof the method of local linearisation of the flow overan airfoil at mach number of unity . in this paper, the pressure distributionat the surface of a symmetricalnon-lifting aerofoil with free streammach number of unity has been investigatedby means of the small-disturbancelinear theory or the method of locallinearization .  and by comparing withthe calculated results based on anhodograph method, the accuracy of theseapproximate methods has been evaluated.  moreover, when these approximatemethods are used for the calculationof the pressure coefficient, some notesnecessary to obtain more correct resultshave been discussed .
