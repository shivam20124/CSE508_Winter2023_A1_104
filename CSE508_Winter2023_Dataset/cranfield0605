pressure measurements on a cone-cylinder-flare configuration at smallincidences for m 6.8 . pressure measurements were made on a slender cone-cylinder-flare configuration,slightly blunted at the nose, for 0, 3 and 6 degrees incidenceat a free-stream mach number of 6.8 .it was found that the surface pressures obtained on the cone agreed withextrapolations to m equals 6.8 of theoretical values given in m.i.t.tables /kopal/for yawed cones, and that impact theory gave a good indicationof the pressure level to be expected on all parts of the bodywhere surface incidence was sufficiently large to merit its use .the semi-angles of the conical and flared parts of the model were boththe pressure level on the flare rose in all cases to approximately thatdeveloped upstream on the cone surface .no evidence of a marked over-expansion to pressures below the freestreamvalue was noticed at the junction between cone and cylinder .
