temperature and velocity profiles in the compressiblelaminar boundary layer with arbitrary distributionof surface temperature . an analysis is presented which enables the temperature profiles,veiocity profiles, heat transfer, and skin friction to be calculatedfor laminar flow over a two-dimensional or axially symmetricsurface without pressure gradient but with an arbitrary analyticdistribution of surface temperature .  the general theory isapplicable to a gas of any prandtl number, although the numericalresults given herein have been computed for air .the predictions of the theory for the special case of constant surfacetemperature are compared with the calculations of crocco .on the basis of this comparison, it is inferred that the presenttheory enables heat-transfer and skin-friction calculations accurateto within about 5 per cent to be made for flight conditionsup to mach numbers near 5 and to within about 1 or 2 per centfor supersonic wind-tunnel conditions up to considerably highermach numbers .a particular effort has been made to present the results, whichare simple considering their generality, in a form that can be usedreadily in practical applications .  from the mathematical pointof view, the theory is applicable to an arbitrary analytic distributionof surface temperature, but in any given practical case it isnecessary that the surface-temperature distribution be approximatedby a polynomial .  the only unknowns in the final equationsdeveloped are the coefficients of this polynomial, so that thework involved in applying the theory in any given case dependsentirely on the work involved in approximating a given surfacetemperaturedistribution by a polynomial .an example is worked out in detail which illustrates some of theprincipal effects of variable surface temperature .  it is shownthat both positively infinite and negatively infinite heat-transfercoefficients can occur .  the anomaly of infinite and negativeheat-transfer coefficients is discussed and attributed to the customarydefinition of the heat-transfer coefficient, which is shownto be fundamentally inappropriate for flows with variable surfacetemperature .  in the particular example considered, a conventionalmethod for calculating the net heat transferred yields completelyincorrect results .  a brief qualitative discussion of thepossible effects of the heat transfer on flow separation is given .in order to facilitate the use of the results, all of the principalequations developed are collected and summarized in the sectionentitled /practical use of results ./
