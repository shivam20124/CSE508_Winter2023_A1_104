free-flight techniques for high speed aerodynamic research . the development rocket-borne and rocket-launched high-speed airplanemodel test is described .  details of airborne components, telemeteringunits, tracking, and their calibration are also discussed .tests on controls, drag measurements, longitudinal stability evaluations,lift measurements, pressure measurements, aeroelastic estimations,and sonic bang recordings are effected .  the reynolds numbersinvolved are much higher than are usual in the wind tunnel, and extensionsof mach numbers are obtained beyond the tunnel limits, both freeof the tunnel wall interference .
