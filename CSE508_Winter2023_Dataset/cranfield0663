viscous flow along a flat plate moving at high speeds . by the distortion of coordinates, it is shown that, in the caseof supersonic viscous flow past a flat plate, the boundary-layerand simple wave theories can be combined to give a completerepresentation of the velocity and pressure fields .  consistentfirst-order solutions are considered .  an expression for the inducedpressure on the plate, correct to the second order, is obtained.  at high mach numbers the important parameter satisfiesthe hypersonic similarity law ,. and for arbitrary mach andreynolds numbers and for different gases, the theoretical curvecorrelates closely the experimental data .  asymptotic shockcurve and skin-friction coefficient are also deduced, but the experimentalverifications are yet to be made .
