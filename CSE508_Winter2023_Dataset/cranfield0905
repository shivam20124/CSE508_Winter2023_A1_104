comparative tests of pitot-static tubes . comparative tests were made on seven conventionalpitot-static tubes to determine their static, dynamic, andresultant errors .  the effect of varying the dynamic opening,static openings, wall thickness, and inner-tube diameterwas investigated .  pressure-distribution measurementsshowing stem and tip effects were also made .  a tentativedesign for a standard pitot-static tube for use in measuringair velocity is submitted .this report covers an investigation conducted underthe auspices of the national research council .
