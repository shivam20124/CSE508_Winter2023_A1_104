some simple solutions to the problem of predictingboundary layer self-induced pressures . simplified theoretical approachesare shown, based on hypersonicsimilarity boundary-layer theory,which allow reasonably accurate estimatesto be made of the surfacepressures on plates on which viscouseffects are important .  the considerationof viscous effects includesthe cases where curved surfaces,stream pressure gradients, and leadingedgebluntness are important factors .
