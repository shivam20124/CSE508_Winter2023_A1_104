interaction of a charged satellite with the ionosphere . the problem of the ion density distribution around acharged satellite has been treated by a numerical methodwhich does not require linearization of the equations or restrictionto infinitesimal objects .  however, magnetic fieldeffects were not considered, and a number of other simplifyingassumptions were required .  some sample calculationsfor spherical satellites are presented, illustrating the generalcharacter of the satellite wake .  calculations of the socalled/charge drag/ were also made, yielding results qualitativelysimilar to those previously obtained by jastrow and pearse .
