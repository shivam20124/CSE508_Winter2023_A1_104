the pressure gradient induced by shear flow past aflat plate . article is a continuation of an earlier note on papers by lion a semiinfinite plate in a uniform shear flow .  li had deducedfrom the form of his equations that stream vorticity caused an inducedpressure gradient in the flow .  later papers by li and murray(amr 15(1962), rev. 7157) support the induced pressure gradienttheory .  the author notes, however, that the mathematics usedby li and murray are not acceptable and the problem thus not resolved.  the present note sets up simple models of complete flowsexaminable by elementary means .  author holds that analysesdemonstrate conclusively that no pressure gradient is induced inthe boundary layer on a flat plate in a limited region of shear flow .he notes that the original question in the case of unbounded shearremains obscure--and anyway an unlimited shear layer is not ofgreat practical importance .
