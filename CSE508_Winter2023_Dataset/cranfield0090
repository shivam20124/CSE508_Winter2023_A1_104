periodic temperature distributions in a two-layer compositeslab . an investigation to determine the feasibility of using aninsulating thermal barrier to protect exposed solid-propellantmotors from atmospheric or environmental temperaturevariations has recently been completed .  in one portion of thisstudy, a solution was developed for the periodic temperature distributionin a two-layer composite slab .  one exposed surface ofthis composite slab was adiabatic, and the other exposed surfacewas subjected to a sinusoidal temperature variation .  the techniqueused in the analysis was similar to that of grober .  in thisnote, pertinent features of the development of the solution aregiven .
