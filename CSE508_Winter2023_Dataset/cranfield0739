the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axialcompression . in two previous papers the authors have discussedin detail the inadequacy of the classical theory ofthin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon ofcylindrical and spherical shells .  it was shown thatnot only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 timeshigher than that found by experiments, but the observedwave pattern of the buckled shell is also differentfrom that predicted .  furthermore, it was pointedout that the different explanations for this discrepancyadvanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are untenablewhen certain conclusions drawn from these explanationsare compared with the experimental facts .by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells theauthors were led to the belief that in general thebuckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be explainedby means of a non-linear large deflection theory .this point of view was substantiated by model experimentson slender columns with non-linear elastic support.  the non-linear characteristics of such structurescause the load necessary to keep the shell in equilibriumto drop very rapidly with increase in wave amplitudeonce the structure started to buckle .  thus, firstof all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell isreleased once the buckling has started,. this explainsthe observed rapidity of the buckling process .  furthermore,as it was shown in one of the previous papersthe buckling load itself can be materially reduced byslight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrationsduring the testing process .in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the caseof a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial compression.  first it is shown by an approximate calculationthat again the load sustained by the shell dropswith increasing deflection .  then the results of thiscalculation are used for a more detailed discussion ofthe buckling process as observed in an actual testingmachine .
