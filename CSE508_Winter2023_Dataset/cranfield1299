hypersonic viscous shock layer . a decade ago tsien (1) (as well as others) and, more recently,adams and probstein (2) have attempted to definethe different regimes of gaseous interactions during highaltitude flight .  in this note some results are presented whichare pertinent to the flight of hypersonic lifting vehicles composedof axially symmetric and two-dimensional elements,.sec. fig. 1 .
